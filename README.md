# Supported Notifications
*New-Garage-Who-Dis* supports the following notification resources by default:
- [T-Notify](https://github.com/TasoOneAsia/t-notify) **(Recomended)** T-Notify offers numerous advantages over any other notification system and has well written [Docs](https://docs.tasoagc.dev/#/).
- [Mythic-Notify](https://github.com/FlawwsX/mythic_notify) This resource uses `SendALert` and not the old way of `DoHudText` so this version is **required** if you want to use *Mythic-Notify*.
